# Preliminary Test for Coronavirus using IoT

To create a testing method for COVID-19 detection which is effective in mass gathering using IOT. To collect data from testing and preform exploratory data analysis on the dataset by making visual reports and make predictions of the future spread of virus in using SVM and Regression ML Models. 


## Methdology
 Data is collected from the people. The obtained data is a actually a raw data.After this  Data Processing has to be done in the next step.It involves Cleaning, Formatting and Sampling of Data. Data is cleaned or otherwise processed to produce a data set usable for processing. It is very likely that the machine learning tools used on the data will inuence the processing you will be required to perform.Exploratory data analysis and statistical modelling may then be performed where Visual Reports are generated out of it. Later Models and Algorithms may be applied to the same data set and can be used to make decisions out of it.
