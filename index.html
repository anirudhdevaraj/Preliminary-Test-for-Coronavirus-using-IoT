          The 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak is an ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There is an obvious concern globally regarding the fact about the emerging coronavirus 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) as a worldwide public health threat. As the outbreak of COVID‐19 causes by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 progresses within China and beyond, rapidly available epidemiological data are needed to guide strategies for situational awareness and intervention. Thousands of people died of coronavirus all over the world and uncountable number of people have been suffering from it. New tools of cell and molecular biology have led to increased understanding of intracellular replication and viral cell biology, and the advent in the past five years of reverse genetic approaches to study coronaviruses has made it possible to begin to define the determinants of viral replication, transspecies adaptation.<br><br>
